This Python script implements a basic calculator capable of performing various mathematical operations. The calculator supports operations with both one and two input values and includes error handling to manage invalid input scenarios.

Features
Addition: add(a, b) - Returns the sum of a and b.
Subtraction: subtract(a, b) - Returns the difference between a and b.
Multiplication: multiply(a, b) - Returns the product of a and b.
Division: divide(a, b) - Returns the quotient of a divided by b. Handles division by zero.
Modulo: modulo(a, b) - Returns the remainder of a divided by b.
Exponentiation: power(a, b) - Returns a raised to the power of b.
Square Root: square_root(a) - Returns the square root of a. Handles negative input by returning an error message.
Logarithm Base 10: log_base_10(a) - Returns the base-10 logarithm of a. Handles input less than or equal to zero by returning an error message.
Natural Logarithm (Base e): log_base_e(a) - Returns the natural logarithm (base e) of a. Handles input less than or equal to zero by returning an error message.
Sine: sine(a) - Returns the sine of angle a (in degrees).
Cosine: cosine(a) - Returns the cosine of angle a (in degrees).
Tangent: tangent(a) - Returns the tangent of angle a (in degrees).
Factorial: factorial(a) - Returns the factorial of a non-negative integer a. Handles non-integer or negative input by returning an error message.
